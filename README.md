## Teacher’s expectations

This website is to prove that you—by yourself—can do everything we covered in class. Look back over all the assignments from the term, determine what kernel of knowledge they were trying to teach you, and see if you can implement it in this website.

There should be a significant example of everything we’ve learned this term in this website. **Leave the impression that you’ve confident with what we’ve learned and can apply everything.**

## Browser testing

In class, week 15, we will be doing lots of peer testing—most of the website needs to be complete by then.

Each person will be assigned a browser or validator and will be required to test everybody’s websites.

---

## Example

See the example website mockups in the “example-wireframes” folder for a better idea of what’s expected. *Remember that these are just wireframes—your website should be fully designed with real images & real text.*

**If your website looks exactly like this you’ll receive a 0.**

## Hand in

Drop this folder into your Markbot application. Make sure to fix all the errors. And submit to Canvas using Markbot.

**When you submit, Markbot will give you `1` or `F`—that’s just so you know that it was handed in on Canvas.** You’ll still have to write a *Request for Grade* and the teacher will still be grading it personally.
